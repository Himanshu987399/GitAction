     * Assume that Apex methods provision immutable data, even if it's possible
     * to mutate the data today. It's a best practice to treat all data that a 
     * component receives as immutable. To mutate the data, make a shallow copy 
     * of the objects you want to mutate. Itâ€™s important to understand this concept 
     * when working with data.
